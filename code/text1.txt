Building data structures and algorithms requires that we communicate detailed instructions to a computer. An excellent way to perform such communications is using a high-level computer language, such as Python. The Python programming language was originally developed by Guido van Rossum in the early 1990s, and has since become a prominently used language in industry and education. The second major version of the language, Python 2, was released in 2000, and the third major version, Python 3, released in 2008. We note that there are significant incompatibilities between Python 2 and Python 3. This book is based on Python 3 (more specifically, Python 3.1 or later). The latest version of the language is freely available at www.python.org, along with documentation and tutorials.
In this chapter, we provide an overview of the Python programming language, and we continue this discussion in the next chapter, focusing on object-oriented principles. We assume that readers of this book have prior programming experience, although not necessarily using Python. This book does not provide a complete description of the Python language (there are numerous language references for that purpose), but it does introduce all aspects of the language that are used in code fragments later in this book.
